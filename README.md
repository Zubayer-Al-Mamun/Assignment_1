# My First Vite + React Project

Welcome to my first project built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/)! This is a simple starting point to learn and experiment with modern front-end development tools.


Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Zubayer-Al-Mamun/Assignment_1.git

# Install dependencies
npm install
